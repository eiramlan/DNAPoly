## Requirements
You need to run DNAPoly V1.0 to generate the relevant DNA network configuratios (3x4, or 4x4). DNAPoly V1.0 is available in this repository for local installation. You need to run RNAStructure (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/rnastructure) to run the sequence-structure optimisation mode.
